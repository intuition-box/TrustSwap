## Weekly Update #1 — First Steps with TrustSwap

Welcome to the very first **TrustSwap Weekly Update!**
Each week, we’ll share the progress of the project to maintain full **transparency** and keep the **community at the center** of this journey.

---

## Conversations with GBM

This week kicked off with a **call with the GBM team**.
We presented TrustSwap, our vision, and explored how their protocol could be integrated into our ecosystem.
The synergy is clear: a **fair and engaging auction system** could greatly enhance TrustSwap’s community-driven dimension.

Their protocol isn’t open-source yet, so there will be a few **technical prerequisites** before we can fully implement it, but things are moving in the right direction.
We don’t plan to prioritize this integration before the mainnet launch, but it’s already **on our roadmap**.

---

## Brainstorming & Design

We also spent time **brainstorming** and **designing upcoming pages** for the application.
The goal: to deliver a **clear, modern, and intuitive interface** that reflects our vision of a community-first DEX.

---

## Tracking & Documentation

* Added a **web analytics tracker** to monitor user activity on the app.
* Began setting up **Docusaurus** to create our **litepaper** and this **blog**.

This documentation will serve as the foundation of our communication and become a **knowledge hub** for the community.

---

## Technical Progress

* **James** implemented the tracker and structured the Docusaurus documentation.
* **Florian** has been developing an **indexer in Ruby on Rails**, which will offer a **graphical view of tokens and other on-chain data** — improving both user experience and data visualization. He’s also working on a **landing page**.

We also started researching **limit order integration** and **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) protection mechanisms**, to help users **avoid inflated fees** and **maximize LP yields**.

---

## What’s Next

Next week, we plan to **publish the litepaper** alongside the new **landing page**.
We’ll also begin development of the **portfolio and charting views**, and if progress goes smoothly, start preparing the first core feature of our DEX: the **Voting Overlay**.

Stay tuned, the adventure is just beginning! 🚀
