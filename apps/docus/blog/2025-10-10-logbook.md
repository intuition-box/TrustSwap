## Weekly Update #2–3 — Litepaper, Landing Page and First Intuition Integration  

The past two weeks have marked an **important milestone** in the development of the TrustSwap project.  
Between design, documentation, and technical integration, we’ve been laying the groundwork for the future ecosystem.  

---

## Writing the Litepaper  
We focused on writing the **Litepaper**, hosted directly on **Docusaurus**.  
This document establishes the foundation of our vision, architecture, and the future direction of TrustSwap.  
Our goal: to make the project **clear, credible, and transparent** for both users and partners.  

---

## Building the Landing Page  
A brand-new **landing page** was created, designed as the main entry point into the TrustSwap ecosystem.  
It highlights the key aspects of the protocol, our partners, and our core values:  
> Trust, Transparency, and Community.  

---

## Brainstorming Future Features  
We also took time to **brainstorm new features** and explore the direction we want the platform to take.  
These discussions are shaping what TrustSwap will become in the long term —  
a **community-governed DEX** built on transparency and trust-based metrics.  

---

## Integrating Intuition — The Trust Gauge  
On the technical side, we started the first real integration of the **Intuition protocol** into TrustSwap.  
This integration introduces the **Trust Gauge**, a visual indicator that reflects the **community’s confidence** in each token.  

This feature will allow users to:  
- **Visualize “For” and “Against” votes** directly on each token,  
- Display a **dynamic trust score**,  
- And eventually feed these insights into **governance and listing decisions**.
