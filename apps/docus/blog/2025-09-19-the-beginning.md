## Why We’re Building TrustSwap

A few months ago, **Florian** and I started talking about the idea of launching a project together. The opportunity came when **Intuition** announced a one-week hackathon to spark development on its blockchain.

We decided to experiment with building a **minimalist DEX**. The development progressed quickly, teamwork was smooth and efficient and by the end of the hackathon, we had a **fully functional DEX**.

That’s when we decided to **keep going**, to turn this experiment into something bigger and explore how **Intuition’s protocol** could power a new kind of DEX.

## From Experiment to Vision

We began thinking about features that would align our DEX with **Intuition’s technology and philosophy**.
During our research, we discovered other protocols that resonated perfectly with our vision — such as **Colony** (for fair, reputation-based DAO governance) and **GBM Auctions** (for transparent and engaging token launches).

These discoveries highlighted a recurring problem across most DEXs:
**voting power is too often concentrated in the hands of a few whales.**
In many models, governance simply decides where rewards go, not how the protocol should truly evolve, leaving most of the community on the sidelines.

## Our Difference

With **TrustSwap**, we want to build **something different**.
Our goal is to put the **community back at the center**, establish a more balanced governance system, and go beyond simple yield distribution.

TrustSwap is not just another DEX:

* It’s a space where **trust** is the core value.
* A platform that leverages innovative protocols to bring **transparency and fairness**.
* A project **built with the community — not just for it.**

## What’s Next

Today, we’ve restructured our codebase and deployed the **first official version of TrustSwap**.

This blog will serve as our **public build journal**, every week, we’ll share updates on our progress, document our choices, and keep our community fully informed.

Welcome to the **TrustSwap adventure.**
