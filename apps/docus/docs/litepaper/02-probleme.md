Despite the major progress made by DEXs, several **structural limitations** remain:

* **Listing transparency:** While the blockchain itself is permissionless, most DEX interfaces are not. Visibility often depends on **whitelists or tokenlists** curated by teams (developers, aggregators). In practice, being “listed” means being **approved by maintainers**, based on subjective criteria, update delays, and with no reliable **trust signals** for users.

* **Lack of reputation and historical context:** Today, a wallet is just an **address without context**, no native trust score, no weighting for longevity, behavior, contribution, or audits. On the project side (deployers, multisig signers, team wallets), **trust isn’t codified**: it’s hard to link a new token to a verifiable **track record**.

* **Limited access for new projects:** Many emerging tokens struggle to secure both **initial liquidity** and **visibility** to attract early users, reinforcing the dominance of already-established tokens.

* **Weak community involvement in governance:** Although many protocols claim to be “decentralized,” actual user participation in decision-making remains minimal, often reduced to symbolic votes on low-stakes proposals.
