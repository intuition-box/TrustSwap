A truly **community-driven DEX** cannot exist without a governance model that is **robust, transparent, and meritocratic**.
**TrustSwap** will rely on the **Colony** protocol — a proven framework (e.g., ShapeShift) for structuring decentralized organizations while maintaining efficiency.

---

### **Governance by Domains and Roles**

Colony structures the organization into **domains** (development, marketing, treasury, partnerships, etc.), each operating semi-autonomously.
Members are assigned **roles** based on their contributions and reputation, ensuring a governance system that is granular, dynamic, and aligned with real project needs.

---

### **Reputation as the Core of Governance**

Unlike systems where **1 token = 1 vote**, Colony introduces **dynamic reputation**:

* It is **earned** through contribution (development, liquidity provision, voting, moderation, etc.).
* It **cannot be bought** and **decays over time** when inactive.
  This prevents power concentration among large holders and establishes a **true meritocracy** where active members hold greater influence.

---

### **Lazy Voting (Consensus by Objection)**

Instead of voting on everything, members **only vote when there’s a credible objection**.

* **Proposal:** a member submits an action (payment, budget, listing, integration).
* **Objection Window:** during a set period, any member with a **minimum reputation threshold** in the relevant domain may **object**.
* **No objection → automatic approval:** the action is executed without delay.
* **Objection → vote:** the proposal moves to a **reputation-weighted vote** within that domain. If rejected, it can be revised and resubmitted.
* **Safeguards:** the higher the **stakes** (amounts, risks), the higher the **objection window** or **reputation threshold** (micro-payments auto-approved, major decisions debated).

**Benefits:**
Less governance “theater,” **faster operational decisions**, **credible vetoes** when needed, and **rights aligned with living reputation** rather than static token weight.

---

### **Decentralized Treasury**

All fees collected by the DEX (swap fees, launchpad fees) feed into the **DAO Treasury**, collectively managed by the community.
Funds can be allocated to **contributors’ rewards**, **grants**, **partnerships**, or **buyback/burn programs** of the native token.

---

### **Strategic Decision-Making**

Major initiatives — such as new listings, protocol integrations, or partnerships — are submitted to the **Colony DAO**.
The **voting power** depends on each member’s **reputation**, ensuring that decisions are driven by **those who actively contribute**.

---

### **Complementarity with Intuition**

**Social and economic reputation** (via Intuition) complements **organizational reputation** (via Colony).
DAO decisions can leverage **on-chain trust data** — for example, prioritizing the listing of tokens validated by reputable users or verifiable attestations.
