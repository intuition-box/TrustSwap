**Phase 1 — Testnet (MVP)**
The experimentation ground.
Deployment of the DEX on testnet with the core building blocks: **swap**, **pools**, **portfolio**, **tracking**, and the first tests of the **Trust Overlay**.

**Phase 2 — Mainnet Launch & Communication**
Official deployment of the DEX.
This is the real kickoff: public launch, start of communication, first users, and first listed projects.
Additional tools will be introduced — **analytics page**, **blog**, **documentation**, and the first **community channels**.

**Phase 3 — Colony Integration & First Intuition Features**
Implementation of decentralized governance through **Colony**: domains, dynamic reputation, and lazy voting.
In parallel, the first integration of **Intuition**, introducing **reputation-based logic** and **for/against voting features** directly on tokens.

**Phase 4 — GBM Launchpad**
Deployment of the **GBM Auctions** module for **fair launches**.

**Phase 5 — Community Action & Exploration of Future Features**
Full openness to community proposals.
Research and testing of new **value-proven protocols** — any module suggested and validated through the DAO.
The goal: to make **TrustSwap** evolve as a **living ecosystem**, powered by its users.
