**TrustSwap** aims to go beyond the limits of traditional DEXs by introducing a new generation of protocol, one where **trust and community participation** stand alongside liquidity as foundational pillars.

* **Trading & Liquidity**
  TrustSwap is currently built on a fork of **Uniswap V2**, chosen for its proven foundation: **v2-core contracts** that have been **audited, formally verified**, and **battle-tested in production since 2020**, processing **hundreds of billions of dollars in cumulative volume**, a benchmark of operational robustness.
  Users can provide or withdraw liquidity like on any modern DEX, while medium-term plans include forking newer versions such as **Uniswap V3**, **Balancer**, or other advanced AMM architectures. ([dapp.org.uk][1])

* **Trust & Reputation via Intuition**
  The goal is to turn **trust** from a mere *social signal* into an **executable parameter** of the DEX. The **Intuition knowledge graph** powers **verifiable triples** (doxxed teams, audits, incidents, fulfilled commitments), allowing these proofs to dynamically adjust the DEX’s **UX, priorities, and limits** in real time.
  By integrating Intuition, TrustSwap gains access to **measurable, reputation-driven features**, a living trust layer directly embedded in market dynamics. A key aspect of this trust layer lies in its machine readability by trading agents, which now play a major role in DeFi. Each token, pool, team, and even each agent, will inherit a programmable TrustScore (powered by verifiable triples) that both the interface and agents can leverage to adapt routing, slippage, and order limits. The result is a reputation-sensitive execution, where financial performance relies as much on proof as on liquidity. ([docs.intuition.systems][4])

* **DAO & Governance via Colony**
  Governance in TrustSwap isn’t symbolic, it’s structural. By launching with **Colony from day one**, the project anchors a **truly decentralized framework**.
  Colony enables **lazy consensus** (votes occur only when there’s objection), **domain-based budgeting**, and **merit-based payments** that grow **non-purchasable reputation**. This ensures smoother decision-making, measurable meritocracy, and clear roles from the very start. ([docs.colony.io][2])

* **Fair Launch via GBM Auctions**
  To empower new projects, TrustSwap integrates **GBM Auctions**, a **bid-to-earn** model that rewards outbid participants with up to **+10%**, aligning engagement with fairness.
  GBM also introduces a **“stabilization buffer”**: part of the auction proceeds can fund **targeted buybacks** to smooth out extreme bids and reduce post-auction “regret.”
  TrustSwap remains **open to other fair launch formats** such as **LBPs** or **CoinMachine**, as long as they ensure **simple, fast, and equitable execution**. ([gbm.auction][3])

By combining these building blocks, **TrustSwap** positions itself as a **community-driven, transparent, and innovative DEX**, where **reputation and collective intelligence** matter as much as **capital and liquidity**.
