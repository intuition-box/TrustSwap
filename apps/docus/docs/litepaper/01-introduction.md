The current DEX ecosystem focuses mainly on **DeFi mechanics** , routing efficiency, new AMM curves, **impermanent loss** protection, **yield** incentives, and so on. These advances are essential, but they overlook another crucial layer: **trust**.

**TrustSwap** introduces a complementary approach, adding a **trust and reputation layer** on top of proven DeFi primitives. From day one, we integrate **Colony** to establish **meritocratic governance** (non-purchasable reputation, domain-based roles) and adopt **lazy voting** principles to avoid “theatrical” governance and streamline decision-making. This foundation puts every participant on the **same ladder of opportunity**: contribute → earn reputation → gain influence.

On the **trust & data** side, the integration of **Intuition** brings **on-chain reputation** and collective knowledge directly into the DEX: *for/against* listing votes, community signals weighted by reputation, and transparency through a graph of claims (audits, team, history, etc.). We’re not replacing liquidity or algorithms, we’re **enhancing** their relevance through verifiable social signals.

For **token launches**, we remain advocates of truly fair, open processes. **GBM Auctions** (bid-to-earn, transparent participation) is an excellent option, but we’re **open to other formats** , such as **LBPs** or **CoinMachine** , to achieve **greater simplicity and faster execution** depending on each project’s context. The goal: more equitable listings.

TrustSwap keeps the **strengths of modern DEXs** while adding a **meritocratic layer of trust and reputation**.
