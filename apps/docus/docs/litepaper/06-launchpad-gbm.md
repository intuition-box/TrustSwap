Launching a token should be **predictable, fair, and resistant to abuse**.
**GBM (Go Bid More)** introduces a **bid-to-earn** framework where price discovery happens publicly, with no gas wars, no sniping, and no insider advantage.

---

### **Bid-to-Earn Model**

With every new bid, the **previous bidder is rewarded**, receiving their initial bid **plus a premium** (up to ~10% depending on the outbid).
Participation is therefore **rewarded even without winning**, encouraging engagement and a healthier dynamic among bidders.

---

### **Fair Token Launch**

* **No opaque private sales.**
* **Public, transparent, and accessible auctions** open to everyone.
* **Fewer pump & dump risks** linked to early insiders.

Price is gradually revealed through bidding, each outbid pays a premium to the previous participant, **aligning incentives** and discouraging **opportunistic sniping**.
Optionally, a **stabilization buffer** can be reserved: a percentage of the auction proceeds may be used to **deepen liquidity** (seed or strengthen LPs) or conduct **targeted buybacks** to smooth extreme bids and reduce post-auction regret.

At the end of a successful auction, a **liquidity pair** (e.g., `$NEW / $tTRUST`) can be **automatically created**, providing a **seamless transition from launch to trading**.

---

### **Transparency & Community**

* Projects are linked to the **Intuition knowledge graph** (claims: audits, team, roadmap…).
* **Community voting** influences post-launch trust and visibility.
* **Reputation** becomes a key driver of long-term project success.

In short, **GBM aligns fairness, transparency, and liquidity from day one**, turning token launches into a **clean, readable, and manipulation-resistant** process.
