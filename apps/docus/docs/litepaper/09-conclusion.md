**TrustSwap** isn’t just another DEX fork, it represents a **new generation of decentralized exchanges**, where **trust** becomes as vital as liquidity.
By integrating **Colony** for meritocratic governance, **Intuition** for on-chain reputation and transparency, and **GBM Auctions** for fair token launches, TrustSwap redefines how communities interact with markets.

Our mission is to build a **more transparent, inclusive, and sustainable** DeFi ecosystem, one where every user strengthens the market itself.
Together, let’s make **trust a liquid asset.**
